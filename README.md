# Object-Oriented-Programming

College Database Project contains numerous packages with different classes. It produces a GUI that allows the user to view student, 
lecturer and class information such as contact info, student grades and whos in what class etc.
It also allows the user to remove any of the above and to modify the students grades and then all the above information can be printed 
to the GUI in a TextArea.

The information is stored in a MySQL workbench on my own machine which can be changed in the code.
